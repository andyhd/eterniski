# Eterniski

You control a skiier slaloming down an endless mountain. The goal is to get as
high a score as possible without crashing.

Unfortunately, I haven't finished the game. There's no collision with trees, so
no real challenge except maybe missing the occasional slalom gate.


## Controls

Keyboard controls are configurable.
Default controls are arrow keys.


## Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- Pygame-CE 2.5.5


## Credits
